# API INSTRUCTIONS

The following Data Harvesting project aims to use the API from rawg.io to see changes in video game trends over the last years.

In order to reproduce the script, you'll need to download an API key from the website: https://rawg.io/ In order to do that, click on "API" on the upper right corner of the webpage. You'll see the button "Get API Key". Click there and register or log in the site first. Once that's done, click on "Get API Key" again. You'll see at the end a code of letters and numbers. That is your API key, copy it.

To load the API key in R, you'll have to follow the instructions in the Rmd itself.
